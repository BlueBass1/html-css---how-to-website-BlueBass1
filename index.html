        Welcome to my how-to guide on how to get started gaming. Gaming is a
        very open ended hobby that allows you to explore many different
        experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        As someone who's looking to pick up the hobby, There are some questions
        that you should ask yourself.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>What Platform would you like to play on?</li>
        <img
          id="platform-examples"
          style="height: 300px; width: 350px"
          class="img-responsive"

          Deciding what you want to play games on is important. When making this
          decision, you want to consider whether what you want out of your
          platform. Do you want something to play at home. Maybe with your
          family? If so, then buying a Nintendo console would be great choice.
          If you want something more customimizable and personal, then getting a
          PC for gaming can be a better choice. There are a few more options
          available out there than the two mentitoned here, but staying in the
          scope of consoles and PC will be all you need to get started.
        </p>
        <li>What genre of games intrest you?</li>
        <img
          id="platform-examples"
          style="height: 300px; width: 350px"
          class="img-responsive"

          Now the other important question is what type game would you like to
          play. Arguably the best aspect of gaming is that there is something
          for anyone who wants play. As I've mentitoned before, this is a very
          open ended hobby. Games range from relaxing exploration and story
          driven adventures, to non-stop action games and fast-paced racing
          games.
